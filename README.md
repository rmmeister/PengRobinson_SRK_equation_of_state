# PengRobinson_SRK_equation_of_state

-Calculate the Z-factors and the molar volumes for pure CO2 at 150ºC and pressures 10, 20, 40,
60, 100, 300, 400 and 500 bar.

a- Using the SRK EoS.
b- Using the PR EoS.
c- Plot the results for Z-factors and molar volumes of CO2 vs P.
d- On the plot, compare the results obtained for the Z-factor from the SRK and the PR
EoS’s with those reported in literature and discuss on the discrepancies.

20 0.970
40 0.942
60 0.913
100 0.869
